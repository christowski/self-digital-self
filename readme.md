# Self / Digital Self
This website gives access to my 2013 bachelor thesis about digital self-reflection and -awareness of millennials. It’s written in German, but the [production blog](https://www.selfdigitalself.tumblr.com) is English.

The site contains a landing page with links to the thesis, a pdf and an e-book download. It’s a simple, static html page with some php for dates and stuff. Nothing fancy!
